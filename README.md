# Game of Life Visualization and Audiolization App

This is a browser-based application that embodies the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway). The app is not only an interesting visual spectacle, but also develops unique acoustic patterns.

## Features

- Visualizes the Game of Life using JavaScript and the Canvas 2D libraries
- Generative audio by analyzing the cellular structure and translating the evolving patterns into sounds.
- Operates beyond Conway's standard rules (B36/S23) with the ability to select from a broad range of rules that create diverse and distinct patterns.

## Demo

You can access the live demo of the application [from this link](https://rawgit.com/dominikwinter/goljs/master/index.html).
